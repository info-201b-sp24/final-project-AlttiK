# Introduction

<p>This project aims to analyze and understand NBA player and team clutch performance using data from:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clutch free throw attempts/percent made compared to overall free throw attempt/percent made</li>
        <li>Clutch shots taken, made, and percentage</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Clutch moments in basketball games are high pressure and show how players deal with that pressure and use their skills. Some research questions include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How do clutch situations impact free throws and field goals made?</li>
        <li>How much does a player's clutch factor play into winning games?</li>
        <li>Does clutch shot efficiency rise with more attempts?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These questions are important because they can enhance people's appreciation for players' skills when they matter most and how pressure impacts performance efficiency in general.</p>"
